## Before you start

I, the creater of OpenChime, am happy to solve any problems you have. Email me at peterdooga@gmail.com, or join my discord server, https://discord.gg/ZqP9ERJ.

This project is not released and is not guarenteed to work on any device.

Tips:
When using linux and some software (such as snowflake ssh), use ctrl+shift+x, ctrl+shift+c, and ctrl+shift+v instead of ctrl+x, ctrl+c, and ctrl+v

## How to install OpenChime from scratch

Note: This tutorial assumes that you are using a headless setup. The same installation can be done with the Pi's terminal or with the desktop with only some minor modifications. If you need help, as mentioned in the "Before you start" section, don't hesitate to ask for help.

To install OpenChime from scratch, you will first need to install a version of linux onto your computer. Because OpenChime is built to be used on Raspberry Pis, this installation procedure will mostly cover installing only on a Raspberry Pi or compatible board.
Install Raspberry Pi OS or Raspberry Pi OS lite onto a SD card of 8gb or more. Don't take it out of your computer though because we need to add a few things. For headless setup, we need to enable ssh. Add a blank file called "ssh" to the boot directory. It should have no file extention. In windows, you will need to enable "File name extensions" to see that there is no file name extention on the file.

To connect OpenChime to your network, you can use either ethernet or WiFi. Ethernet is recommended, as WiFi is not built in to older Pis and can be unreliable. If you plan to use ethernet, please skip the WiFi setup step below.

If you plan to use WiFi connectivity, you will also need to tell the Pi what your WiFi ssid and password is. To do this, create another file in the boot directory called "wpa_supplicant.conf". Note that the file name extension must be ".conf". Edit this file with an advanced text editor like notepad++. We need to edit this with Unix mode. In notepad++ you can select "Edit > EOL Conversion > Unix (LF)". Now insert the following text into the new empty file:

`
network={
 ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
 psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
`

Replace the ssid and password with your ssid and password. You can also put a lot more details about your network in here, but I will not go over that. 

Now you have finished the initial setup. You can eject and remove the SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
If necessary, plug in the ethernet connection or wifi dongle. Then power on the Raspberry Pi by pluging in the USB cable.
To connect to the pi, launch your favorite ssh/sftp client. winscp works great for windows, and snowflake ssh or filezilla for any other operating system. I personally recommend using snowflake ssh as it is cross platform. You can also use your terminal for ssh if you have a sftp only client.

You now need to find the Raspberry Pi's IP address. The easiest way to do this is plug in a keyboard and a monitor to the Pi's usb and hdmi ports. Then type in the username, "pi", and the password, "raspberry". These are the default credentials which we will change later. Then when you see a terminal screen, type in "hostname -I" and press enter. It should show you the Pi's IP address. If this does not work for some reason, you can also do "ifconfig" in the terminal to see all the Pi's network interfaces. Note that the Pi will need access to the internet for setup. 

Once you have the Pi's ip address, you can type that into your ssh/sftp client. Then if it needs a username and password, use the credentials above. ("pi", "raspberry")

Now we can get your Raspberry Pi set up with OpenChime. Download the "install_scratch.zip" file from the github repository. (https://github.com/PKCubed/OpenChime) It should contain all the files needed to install OpenChime. Extract it into a directory on your computer in which you can easily access it. Use your sftp client to put in in the Pi's home/pi directory. Then go to the terminal, and type in, "cd /home/pi" then press enter. Now type in "sh dependencies.sh" and press enter. It may take quite a while to install all the dependencies.

Now take the "openchime" folder from the "install_scratch" folder that you extracted and put it in the same directory as "dependencies.sh".
