            If you want to install OpenChime on an 
            existing Raspberry Pi that already does 
            something, for example, serves a website, 
            you need to install OpenChime from scratch.<br>
            <br>
            To install from scratch, you will need to 
            first have a Raspberry Pi with Raspberry 
            Pi OS, or Raspberry Pi OS Lite installed. 
            You can install those from the 
            <a href="">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>. 
            Then you need to run a few commands in the 
            terminal. Either connect a screen to your 
            Raspberry Pi, or connect via SSH. Then 
            download the installer file with this 
            command.<br>
            <br>
            insert installer download command here
