            To setup OpenChime, make sure that your 
            Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet 
            via Ethernet or Wifi. If using Wifi, make 
            sure that you have a wifi dongle, or 
            built in wifi on your Raspberry Pi we 
            will configure the ssid and password 
            later. To configure OpenChime, you will 
            need a USB drive. It doesn't need to be 
            very big because it will only have a few 
            text files and audio files on it. This 
            USB drive is what is used to configure 
            and schedule OpenChime.
